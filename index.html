                            Berea is a small town located in the central part  of Kentucky. The town is surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more.  The town holds a yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">
                            However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially integrated, as well  as the first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely,  it charges no tuition — every student receives  a full-tuition scholarship. </p>
